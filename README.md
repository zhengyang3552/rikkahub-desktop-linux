## 🚀 Download

Linux packages are built by CI straight from the synced upstream source and published on
this repo's [Releases](https://github.com/zhengyang3552/rikkahub-desktop-Linux/releases)
page (x86_64).

**Debian / Ubuntu / Mint users should prefer the apt repository** — set it up once and
regular `apt upgrade` will pick up new versions automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zhengyang3552.github.io/rikkahub-desktop-linux/key.gpg \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/rikkahub-desktop.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rikkahub-desktop.gpg] https://zhengyang3552.github.io/rikkahub-desktop-linux/ ./" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rikkahub-desktop.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install rikkahub-desktop
```

Or download individual packages for manual install:

* Debian / Ubuntu / Mint: rikkahub-desktop_X.X.X_amd64.deb

  ```
  sudo dpkg -i rikkahub-desktop_X.X.X_amd64.deb
  ```

* Arch / Manjaro: rikkahub-desktop-X.X.X-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst

  ```
  sudo pacman -U rikkahub-desktop-X.X.X-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
  ```
  
* AppImage (any distro): rikkahub-desktop-X.X.X-x86_64.AppImage

  ```
  chmod +x rikkahub-desktop-X.X.X-x86_64.AppImage
  ./rikkahub-desktop-X.X.X-x86_64.AppImage
  ```
  
* Portable: Rikkahub_X.X.X_linux_x64.tar.gz

  ```
  tar -xzf Rikkahub_X.X.X_linux_x64.tar.gz
  ./rikkahub-pc/rikkahub-pc
  ```
  
* NixOS: rikkahub-desktop-bin-X.X.X-nix (Nix closure + derivation, see README inside)
* Source: rikkahub-desktop-X.X.X.tar.gz (build from source)

After launch the UI is served at http://localhost:8080 and opens in your default browser.
Data (conversations, settings, uploaded files) lives in
`~/.local/share/rikkahub-desktop` by default — override with `RIKKAHUB_PC_DATA_DIR`.

No telemetry, no admin, no cloud account required. Everything is local.

## 📦 Community packages

Native packages are now built officially by this repo's CI (see
[Download](#-download) above). The community additionally maintains alternative install
channels — **these are maintained by their respective authors, not this project**:

| Distribution | How to install | Maintainer |
|---|---|---|
| NixOS / Nix | `nur.repos.af-nur.rikkahub-desktop` (built from source, binary cache `af-nur.cachix.org` recommended) | [@AstralFlare-owo](https://github.com/AstralFlare-owo) |

The `.deb` / `.pkg.tar.zst` packages previously hand-built by
[@Noah0932](https://github.com/Noah0932) are superseded by the CI-built assets above.
Many thanks to both for covering these distributions.

## 🏗️ Build from source

Building the installer locally requires the following — **for developers only**:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.1+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain (stable, MSVC target — picked automatically by rustup
  on Windows)
- [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload (provides MSVC linker + Windows SDK)

```powershell
# 1. Compile the embedded backend (Bun --compile → single Windows exe)
cd pc-server
bun run compile

# 2. Copy the freshly compiled sidecar to where Tauri expects it
cp ../dist/rikkahub-pc.exe ../web-ui/src-tauri/binaries/rikkahub-server-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe

# 3. Build the SPA, Tauri shell, and NSIS installer in one go
cd ../web-ui
bun install
./src-tauri/tauri-msvc.cmd build --bundles nsis
```

The shipped installer lands at `dist/Rikkahub_X.X.X_x64-setup.exe`. The wrapper
`tauri-msvc.cmd` activates the MSVC environment and uses an ASCII-only `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
to work around two Windows quirks (Git Bash's `link.exe` conflict and the project path
containing non-ASCII characters).

### Dev workflow

```powershell
# Backend on http://localhost:8080
cd pc-server
bun run server.ts

# Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to :8080)
cd ../web-ui
bun run dev
```

For frontend-only iteration just open `http://localhost:5173` in any browser — the custom
titlebar auto-hides outside the Tauri shell so the SPA stays usable.

### Smoke test

```powershell
cd pc-server
bun run smoke:request-chain
```

Spins up mock provider / MCP / WebDAV / S3 servers and exercises the full request chain.

### Linux binary

Build a self-contained Linux x64 binary (requires only [Bun](https://bun.sh/)):

```bash
# 1. Build the SPA
cd web-ui && bun install && bun run build

# 2. Compile the server binary
cd ../pc-server && bun run compile:linux
# → dist/rikkahub-pc
```

Run it:

```bash
./dist/rikkahub-pc
# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
# Data is stored in ./pc-data/
```

**Required system packages** — install before using the relevant features:

| Package | Feature |
|---|---|
| `espeak-ng` | System TTS (text-to-speech tool, voice playback) |
| `xclip` (X11) or `wl-clipboard` (Wayland) | Clipboard read/write tool |
| `unzip`, `zip` | Backup restore / skill import from ZIP |

On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install espeak-ng xclip unzip zip`  
On Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install espeak-ng xclip unzip zip`

Missing tools are detected at startup and listed as warnings — the server still starts and
all other features remain available.

### Docker

A multi-arch image can be built from the included `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t rikkahub-pc .
```

Run with persistent data:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name rikkahub \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./pc-data:/app/pc-data \
  -e RIKKAHUB_PASSWORD=your-password \
  rikkahub-pc
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The image uses
`distroless/base-debian12` and bundles `unzip`/`zip`; clipboard and TTS are
not available inside a headless container.

**Set `RIKKAHUB_PASSWORD` (or pass `--password <password>`) whenever the server
is reachable beyond your own machine** — the container binds `0.0.0.0`, so
without a password anyone on the same network can read your conversations and
API keys. With a password set, the web UI shows an unlock prompt and every API
request requires the issued access token. The desktop app binds `127.0.0.1`
and does not need this.


**Security note for LAN / public deployments:** the AI's `scrape_web` tool fetches
whatever URL the model asks for *from inside the container* — a prompt-injected web page can
steer it into probing internal services or cloud metadata endpoints (SSRF). If that matters in
your network, isolate the container's network or restrict its egress.

### Reverse proxy (nginx)

Two things matter when putting RikkaHub behind a reverse proxy (e.g. for HTTPS):

- **Host passthrough** — the server rejects state-changing requests whose `Origin` header
  doesn't match the request `Host` (CSRF protection). A default `proxy_pass` rewrites
  `Host` to the upstream address, so every POST/DELETE fails with 403 — "the page loads but
  nothing saves". Forward the original host with `proxy_set_header Host $host`.
- **Streaming** — SSE responses carry `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, which makes nginx disable
  response buffering for them automatically; `proxy_buffering off` is only a fallback for
  proxies that ignore the header.

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name rikka.example.com;
    # ssl_certificate ...; ssl_certificate_key ...;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;              # keep the Origin/Host CSRF check working
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;   # WebSocket (voice input)
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_buffering off;                      # fallback; SSE already sends X-Accel-Buffering: no
        proxy_read_timeout 1h;                    # long-lived SSE / generation streams
        client_max_body_size 0;                   # backup restore uploads can be hundreds of MB
    }
}
```

Set `RIKKAHUB_PASSWORD` whenever the proxy makes the server reachable beyond localhost.
